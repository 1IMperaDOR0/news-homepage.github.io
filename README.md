- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Markup languages ​​(HTML5 and CSS3)
- Semantic framework
- Flexbox and responsiveness
- Programming language (JavaScript)
- Interactivity

### What I learned

I used this challenge to reinforce the programming concepts I learned after a few days without contact, such as tags, responsiveness, javascript and github commands in cmd. I believe I did well. The only problem was using versioning in github, which was not actually applied. So I checked some articles that helped me better understand how this concept works. Here they are if you want to consult them: [About Release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases) and [Managing Releases in a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository).

### Continued development

As I mentioned before, I didn't feel comfortable doing release versioning, so I intend, in addition to the articles seen, to do more projects that help me put into practice the knowledge acquired. In addition, I need to find challenges that require more manipulation of DOM elements through JavaScript to further develop my programming logic.
